It simplifies the backup and restore process.\nSteps:\nEnable Backup: Navigate to your VM in the Azure portal. Select Backup under the VM\u0026rsquo;s settings. Configure the Recovery Services Vault if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have one. Define Backup Policy: Choose a pre-existing backup policy or create a custom one. Specify the backup frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) and retention duration. Start Backup: Once the policy is configured, initiate the first backup. This is a great option if you want fully automated backups. It also supports long-term retention and is integrated with Azure for easy management and monitoring.\nSnapshots #Disk snapshots capture the state of a disk at a specific point in time. They are flexible and work well for manual or ad hoc backups. I give a detailed guide in this post here\nSteps:\nCreate a Snapshot: Navigate to the disk attached to your VM in the Azure portal. Click Create Snapshot. Choose the snapshot type (incremental or full). Store the Snapshot: Select the storage type (Standard or Premium). Snapshots are stored in your Azure subscription. Use the Snapshot: Create a new managed disk from the snapshot to restore data or recover a VM. Snapshots are cost-effective, especially with incremental storage. They\u0026rsquo;re quick to create and restore, making them ideal for ad hoc or immediate backups.\nExporting and Downloading #This method involves exporting the VM’s disk(s) to a secure URL for manual download. It’s useful for maintaining local copies or transferring data outside Azure.\nSteps:\nExport the Disk: Navigate to the disk in the Azure portal. Click Export and generate a secure download URL. Set the URL expiration time (e.g., 1 hour). Download the Disk: Use the secure URL to download the disk as a VHD file. Store the VHD file locally or in another storage system. Restore from the Disk: Upload the VHD back to Azure or another environment if recovery is needed. Create a new disk from the uploaded VHD and attach it to a VM. This is a great option for ensuring an offline copy of your VM data. It’s useful for migrating data between environments and doesn’t rely on Azure-specific services.\nComparison of Methods # Method Automation Cost Efficiency Use Case Azure Backup High Moderate Long-term, automated backups with retention Disk Snapshots Moderate High (incremental) Ad hoc or manual point-in-time backups Export \u0026amp; Download Low Low (storage + egress) Offline or external storage, data migration Snapshot Guide #The method I’ve chosen for my use case is Snapshots. I’ve used them throughout my Azure projects, and they’ve come in handy whenever I made configuration mistakes or needed to start over with a lab. For example, in the osTicket project, the installation process is lengthy. Instead of going through it every time, I would create a snapshot after finishing the installation. This allowed me to focus on the ticketing system rather than repeatedly setting up the application.\nAs outlined in the snapshot steps above, here’s how I used snapshots for backups:\nCreate the Backup #Go to the VM you want to back up and navigate to the disk settings. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the option to create a snapshot.\nSelect VM disk and create snapshot Give the snapshot a name and make sure to select Incremental to save storage space and reduce costs.\nGive the snapshot a meaningful name Now, this is good so far. However, we can take an extra step and create a disk from the snapshot.\nCreate the disk Select snapshot to create disk Ensure that the region is the same as the snapshot\u0026rsquo;s region. Once that’s done, you have a backup of your VM!\nRestore from Backup # Swap Disk Select Disk The next time you want to restore to a previous point, simply use the created disk, swap it, and that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nConclusion #Each method has its strengths:\nAzure Backup is best for automated, long-term solutions. Snapshots are ideal for quick, cost-effective point-in-time backups. Exporting Disks works well for manual backups or offline storage. By understanding your needs—such as automation, retention, and cost—you can choose the best method for creating backups of your Azure VMs.\n","date":"12 January 2025","permalink":"/posts/creating-backups-for-vms-in-azure/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Creating Backups for VMs in Azure"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Daniel's Blog","summary":"","title":"Daniel's Blog"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/vms/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"VMs"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/windows/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Windows"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/active-directory/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Active Directory"},{"content":"In this lab, we will explore File Permissions in a domain environment managed through Active Directory.

I will be configuring DNS records and observing their behavior. For this, I am using two virtual machines from a previous lab. Log in to both the domain controller and the client as administrators.\nEnvironments and Technologies Used # Microsoft Azure Remote Desktop Active Directory Domain Services Command Line Operating Systems Used # Windows Server 2022 Windows 10 Pro (22H2) Hostname Resolution Order #On the client VM, execute the following command:\nipconfig /displaydns # Put output into a file ipconfig /displaydns \u0026gt; file.txt This command displays the DNS cache, which is the first place the computer will check when trying to resolve a domain.\nThe next location the system will search is the hosts file, found at:\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\nHosts File The system will check for any defined hostnames here. If no matches are found in the hosts file, it will then contact the DNS server.\nTo summarize, here\u0026rsquo;s the order in which a hostname is resolved:\nDNS Cache Hosts File DNS Server Add Hostname #Now, on the domain controller, let\u0026rsquo;s add a hostname mainframe that points to the private IP address of this VM.\nAdding Hostname: \u0026ldquo;mainframe\u0026rdquo; Once the entry is created, try pinging mainframe from the client. You should receive the following response.\nPinging mainframe Change Hostname IP #Next, let\u0026rsquo;s change the IP for the mainframe hostname to Google\u0026rsquo;s DNS server, 8.8.8.8.\nChanging IP for mainframe Try pinging again, and you\u0026rsquo;ll notice it still resolves to the domain controller. This is because the system is checking the DNS cache. To view the cache, run the following command:\nipconfig \\displaydns Ping mainframe again Clear DNS Cache #You\u0026rsquo;ll see that the mainframe hostname still points to the domain controller\u0026rsquo;s IP address. To resolve this, you can clear the DNS cache using the following command:\nipconfig \\flushdns At this point, the system will check the cache, then the hosts file, and finally the DNS server—just as it did in this case!\nClear DNS cache Add CNAME Record #Next, let\u0026rsquo;s create a CNAME record pointing to www.google.com. You can name this record whatever you prefer. I\u0026rsquo;ll name it idk. Afterward, try pinging that name from the client.\nAdd CNAME record As you can see, the ping successfully resolves to google.com!\nPing CNAME record What I Learned #In this lab, I learned how DNS resolves hostnames by checking three main places: the DNS cache, the hosts file, and the DNS server. I got hands-on experience adding a hostname, updating its IP address, and clearing the DNS cache when things didn\u0026rsquo;t work as expected. I also explored creating CNAME records to redirect to other domains, like pointing to www.google.com. This gave me a better understanding of how DNS works in practice and how to troubleshoot and configure it effectively.\n","date":"29 December 2024","permalink":"/projects/understanding-dns-with-azure/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Understanding DNS with Azure"},{"content":"Managing Account Lockouts and User Security in Active Directory #When a user attempts to log in unsuccessfully multiple times, it can signal a potential security threat, and the account should be locked to prevent further attempts. As a domain admin, you can configure account lockout policies on the domain controller. To do this, right-click on Domain Group Policy and select Edit. Then, navigate to the following path:\nComputer Configuration \u0026gt; Policies \u0026gt; Windows Settings \u0026gt; Security Settings \u0026gt; Account Policies \u0026gt; Account Lockout Policy\nYou should see a configuration similar to the one below:\nAccount Lockout Policy Note that the policy changes may not take effect immediately. To enforce the policy, log into the client as an admin and run the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:\ngpupdate /force Once the update is complete, log out of the client. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s simulate a scenario where a user incorrectly enters their password multiple times. After exceeding the threshold (e.g., 5 incorrect attempts), the system will lock the account, and you’ll see a message such as User Account Locked.\nEven if the correct password is entered after the lockout, login will not be permitted.\nTo resolve this, go back to the domain controller, locate the locked-out user, and access their Properties. Under the Account tab, you’ll see an option to Unlock account\u0026hellip;. Select it and click Apply.\nUnlocking User Account The user should now be able to log in again successfully.\nAlternatively, if the user has forgotten their password, you can reset it by selecting the Reset Password option, as shown below:\nUnlocking User Account with New Password Disabling and Enabling Accounts #You also have the ability to disable user accounts in Active Directory. If an account is disabled and the user attempts to log in, they will see a message such as Your Account Has Been Disabled.\nTo re-enable the account, simply go back into the account\u0026rsquo;s Properties and enable the account again. The user will be able to log in once more.\nMonitoring Account Activities #Active Directory also provides logging features to track failed login attempts. You can monitor these events using the Event Viewer. In the example below, we can see Audit Failure logs indicating the five failed login attempts we simulated earlier.\nEvent Viewer What I Learned #This lab was an invaluable opportunity to dive into managing account security and lockout policies in Active Directory. I explored how to configure account lockout thresholds, enforce policies across the domain, and simulate failed login attempts to better understand the lockout process.\nUnlocking accounts, resetting passwords, and disabling or enabling user access gave me practical insight into managing real-world scenarios. Monitoring failed login attempts through the Event Viewer also highlighted how essential audit logs are for identifying potential security threats.\n","date":"28 December 2024","permalink":"/projects/active-directory/3-simulation/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Active Directory: Managing User Account Security and Simulating Lockouts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Powershell"},{"content":"Environments and Technologies Used # Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute) Remote Desktop Active Directory Domain Services Operating Systems Used # Windows Server 2022 Windows 10 Pro (22H2) ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/active-directory/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Windows Active Directory in Azure"},{"content":"I will now be configuring Active Directory by setting up organizational units, creating an administrator account with domain privileges, joining a client machine to the domain, and scripting the creation of multiple user accounts with proper permissions.\nCreating Organizational Units and Admin User #After setting up Active Directory on our virtual machine and successfully logging into the newly created domain, we proceeded to organize it by creating specific organizational units.

Through hands-on experimentation, we’ll observe how various network protocols such as ICMP, SSH, and DHCP operate in a cloud environment. Additionally, we’ll delve into configuring Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control and secure traffic flow between VMs. This lab offers a practical way to understand network communication and security measures in Azure\nBefore We Get Started #Environments and Technologies Used # Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute) Remote Desktop Various Command-Line Tools Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP) Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer) Operating Systems Used # Windows 10 (22H2) Ubuntu Server 24.04 Setup #Creating the VMs #I created a resource group to place these virtual machines in. I named mine RG-Network-Activities.\nResource Group Ensure the VMs are in the same:\nresource group region virtual network Windows VM #I placed this VM in the resource group I just created and within the same region. Make sure to select the Windows 10 Pro image.\nI selected a standard VM size with 2 vCPUs and 16 GiB of memory. Windows VM creation The final step is to create a virtual network. For this project, I created a new network and named it lab-vnet.\nVirtual Network Linux VM #I followed the same steps as for the Windows VM, but selected the appropriate image. In my case, I chose the latest Ubuntu Server LTS version. The VM size doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter here.\nLinux VM creation However, under the Administrator Account, make sure to change the setting from SSH public key to Password. Although SSH public key is a good security practice, this is just a demo and will be deleted soon after.\nLinux Authentication Type Connect to Windows VM #To connect to the Windows VM, we need a way to access it using the RDP protocol. This allows us to interact with the VM as if we were directly using the computer screen.\nFor Windows use: Remote Desktop Client For Mac use: Microsoft Remote Desktop For Linux use: FreeRDP For more info on how to use FreeRDP, read this post\nObservations #ICMP Traffic #Within Wireshark, I filtered for ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic and opened PowerShell to execute a command called ping. Ping utilizes ICMP, which is used by devices in a network to communicate problems within data transmission. I used ping to see if I can communicate with the Ubuntu VM using its private IP address. The private IP of the Linux VM in my case is 10.0.0.5. When we run the ping command, the following output will be displayed.\nObserve ICMP Traffic You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that 10.0.0.4 (Windows VM) sends a request to 10.0.0.5 (Linux VM), which then causes the Linux VM to reply!\nConfigure Network Security Groups (Firewall) #Within the Azure portal, I opened the networking settings for the Ubuntu VM and added an inbound security rule to block ICMP traffic. I make sure to have the priority higher than SSH (300) to ensure the rule applies first.\nDeny ICMP Traffic Upon returning to the Windows VM, I notice that the ICMP traffic is blocked now that the inbound security rule is in place.\nRequest Timeout If you delete this rule, the ping resolves without timing out!\nSSH Traffic #Next, let\u0026rsquo;s observe the SSH traffic. From the Windows VM, we can SSH into the Linux VM using its private IP address.\nWe can open up powershell and type the following\nssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;private_ip_of_linux_vm\u0026gt; Then, simply enter the password for the user. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice the SSH traffic in Wireshark whenever you start typing in the command line, as shown below.\nSSH SSH is similar to the RDP protocol (3389) in that it allows remote access to a machine. However, SSH is a text-based protocol designed for command-line interactions, whereas RDP provides a graphical user interface. Both achieve remote access, but they are optimized for different use cases.\nDHCP Traffic #Now, let\u0026rsquo;s observe some DHCP traffic. This protocol is used when a device or node is not assigned a static IP and needs to request an IP from the DHCP server. To see this in action, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to create a small batch file.\nipconfig /release ipconfig /renew I created this file inside my Downloads directory and named it dhcp.bat. Then, I executed the file from the command line.\nNow, this may disconnect you from the RDP client tool you\u0026rsquo;re using. This is fine, as we\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to observe the traffic when logging back into the Windows VM.\nDHCP Traffic Although the IP address appears the same as before, we actually release the IP the VM was initially assigned and receive a new IP from the DHCP server.\nWhat I Learned #In this lab, I learned how to observe and analyze network traffic between Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) using Wireshark. I explored how various protocols like ICMP, SSH, and DHCP function in a cloud environment. By configuring Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), I discovered how to control traffic flow between VMs, including blocking ICMP traffic to enhance security. I also gained a deeper understanding of how DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses and how these can change when renewing leases. Additionally, I learned the differences between RDP and SSH for remote access and saw how these protocols impact network communication. This lab reinforced the importance of network traffic analysis and security configurations in cloud environments.\n","date":"24 December 2024","permalink":"/projects/inspecting-traffic-between-azure-vms/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/ssh/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SSH"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/bootloader/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bootloader"},{"content":"Reason #If you\u0026rsquo;re dual-booting Windows and Linux.
